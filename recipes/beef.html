    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mongolian beef is a popular American-Chinese takeout dish often made with thin slices of flank steak, accompanied by veggies, spiked with ginger, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, and scallions. Here, I obviously took many liberties adapting the original
        stir-fry steak dish into a meatball and ramen skillet. One thing I kept the same: cornstarch. It makes the meat crispy and caramelized on the outside, and it helps thicken the sauce, giving it a velvety texture. If you don't have any on hand (or
        you forgot to pick some up), feel free to skip it. But make sure to use it next time! (Rest assured, there will be a next time!)</p>
