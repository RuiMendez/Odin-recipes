    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This version of pork fried rice is our go-to when we want to use ground pork. Aside from the rice and the eggs, everything can be substituted. Any combo of cooked and cooled rice (it crisps up better when the starches get a chance to set!), eggs, aromatics
        (like onion, shallots, scallions, garlic, and ginger), and protein (pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu) will turn out amazing. All in all, it's a pretty balanced meal, especially when you make it at home. Best of all, it's totally flexible to your
        desired add-ons and toppings or garnishes.
