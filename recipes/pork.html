    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This version of pork fried rice is our go-to when we want to use ground pork. Aside from the rice and the eggs, everything can be substituted. Any combo of cooked and cooled rice (it crisps up better when the starches get a chance to set!), eggs, aromatics
        (like onion, shallots, scallions, garlic, and ginger), and protein (pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu) will turn out amazing. All in all, it's a pretty balanced meal, especially when you make it at home. Best of all, it's totally flexible to your
        desired add-ons and toppings or garnishes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4" pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. ground pork</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>tbsp. grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 c. frozen peas</li>

        <li>2 tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. hoisin sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Add eggs and let sit for a few seconds before lightly scrambling and folding the egg mixture over itself. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, heat remaining tablespoon oil then add onion and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender. Add the ground pork to the skillet and season with salt and pepper, then cook until the pork is no longer
            pink and is starting to caramelize. Stir in ginger, garlic, and peas and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the rice then stir in soy sauce, hoisin, scallions, and sesame oil. Toss to combine and fold in scrambled eggs. Serve immediately.</li>
